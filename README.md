# Night Owl Palette

> A set of variables representing [Night Owl][night-owl] colors

Night Owl is a great color palette that I often find myself wanting to port to other platforms. I have always wished I had an easy reference for the colors, so I built this repo to define them all as variables that I can import into other projects.
